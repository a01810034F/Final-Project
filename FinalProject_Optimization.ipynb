    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This final project studies a facility location problem for Community Centers for Digital Innovation (CCDI) in the Metropolitan Area of Monterrey (MAM), in the state of Nuevo León, Mexico.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is framed as a decision problem faced by the Dirección de Innovación y Tecnología Educativa of the Ministry of Education of Nuevo León. As part of a digital inclusion program, this public agency wants to deploy new CCDI where citizens can access computers, internet and basic digital skills training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the first deployment phase is not to open a CCDI in every municipality, but to install a limited number of regional hubs that will serve several municipalities around them. In this phase the agency decided, for organisational and staffing reasons, to open at most three CCDI that will be operated directly by the state. The number three comes from the available teams and budget for three complete infrastructure packages; smaller computer rooms in schools and libraries remain managed by other programs and are not included in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the point of view of optimization, the problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) location–allocation model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Location decision: in which municipalities to open the large CCDI hubs.  \n",
    "- Allocation decision: which municipality population is served by each open CCDI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to minimise a proxy of the total travel effort of the users, under capacity and equity-by-region constraints. The model is solved with integer programming methods (LP relaxation and branch-and-bound), and the results are analysed critically to see if they make sense as a public policy proposal.\n"

    "## Description of the case study\n",
    "\n",
    "The Metropolitan Area of Monterrey (MAM) includes several municipalities with strong social and economic differences. In this project we consider six of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monterrey  \n",
    "- Guadalupe  \n",
    "- Apodaca  \n",
    "- San Nicolás de los Garza  \n",
    "- Santa Catarina  \n",
    "- General Escobedo  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment of the project we assume that there are no CCDI of this specific program yet. There are existing computer rooms in schools and libraries, but they are managed by other initiatives and are considered out of the scope. The Ministry wants to decide where to locate three new large CCDI that will operate as regional hubs for digital inclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each municipality we use the total population from the 2020 Mexican census and we estimate that 15 percent of the inhabitants are potential active users of the CCDI (students, teachers, young adults and job seekers). This factor is the same for all municipalities to keep the model simple and transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two extra policy requirements come from the priority maps of the state development plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the east / north-east corridor (Guadalupe and Apodaca), and  \n",
    "- the north / west belt (San Nicolás de los Garza, General Escobedo and Santa Catarina)  \n",
    "\n",
    "are identified as zones with high population and relatively lower access to higher education institutions. To reflect this in the model, the agency asks that at least one CCDI must be located in each of those two macro-zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physically, whenever a municipality is selected as a CCDI location, the center is assumed to be built next to the city council building of that municipality (that is, near the presidencia municipal). This convention is used both for the distance data and for the interpretation of the solution.\n"

    "We work with six municipalities of the MAM. For each of them we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total population 2020 (INEGI census data, approximated).  \n",

    "- Pairwise distances between municipalities in kilometres.\n",

    "Distances are approximate driving distances measured with Google Maps between the city council building of municipality i and the city council building of municipality j, rounded to the nearest kilometre. The idea is that each CCDI will be located next to the city council of its municipality, so these distances represent how far people must travel from one municipality to reach the CCDI placed by another municipality.\n"

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is not directly interpretable for citizens but is useful to compare alternative scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation of constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The main constraints are checked as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unique assignment: each municipality appears exactly once in the assignment list, so the equation sum_j x_ij = 1 holds for all i.  \n",
    "- Capacity: the total demand assigned to each open CCDI is below the capacity C = 200000 users, so no centre is overloaded.  \n",
    "- Maximum number of centres: there are exactly three locations with y_j = 1, so the planning constraint is satisfied with equality.  \n",
    "- Equity east / north-east: Apodaca is open, so y_Gua + y_Apo >= 1 holds.  \n",
    "- Equity north / west: San Nicolás de los Garza is open, so y_Sn + y_Esc + y_Sc >= 1 is also satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are validated carefully, and the analysis is critical and not only mechanical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if three CCDI are enough to cover all the potential demand from the capacity point of view, the limit of three hubs is not interpreted as a pure budget constraint inside the model. Instead, it represents a policy decision for phase I: the Ministry decided to open three large regional CCDI, and the optimisation helps to choose their locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution shows an interesting pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Monterrey and Apodaca appear as natural hubs for the central and east / north-east parts of the MAM, because they concentrate high demand and are relatively central.  \n",
    "2. San Nicolás de los Garza acts as a hub for the north / west part, serving itself, Santa Catarina and General Escobedo.  \n",
    "3. Some municipalities do not receive a CCDI in their own territory (Guadalupe, Santa Catarina, General Escobedo), but are served by nearby hubs. This can be politically sensitive even if it is optimal in terms of distance.  \n",
    "4. If the capacity C were reduced or the number of hubs B increased, the model would probably open more CCDI and reduce travel distances for the outer municipalities. This kind of sensitivity analysis is important before taking a final political decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the solution is coherent with the structure of the model and reveals the tension between efficiency (minimising travel cost) and territorial equity.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final project we modeled and solved a location–allocation problem for Community Centers for Digital Innovation in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area. The model combines elements from linear programming and integer programming, using binary variables and several constraints on capacity, equity and assignment of demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using real population data and documented assumptions for demand and distances between city councils, the optimisation model gives a concrete proposal of where to open the CCDI hubs and how to assign each municipality to them. The use of a mixed-integer linear programming solver with branch-and-bound is necessary, because the structure of the problem is not simple and the best solution can not be found just by inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology can be extended to more municipalities, different types of facilities, or additional criteria such as installation costs, marginalisation indexes or priorities for vulnerable groups.
